				<h1>Recollections</h1>

				<h2>A puzzle-platform game inspired by the seasons and human life stages.</h2>

				<p>This project is a collaboration with Instituto Superior Técnico de Lisboa’s Systems 
				and Computer Engineering Master Students, who developed the game. My role was 
				to create all the visual  elements, such as: UI elements, backgrounds, characters, 
				collectables and assets and game poster.
				<br>The background illustrations were based on nature, inspired by a minimalist 
				approach that would convey the feelings associated with each season 
				straightforwardly. Summer is bright and exudes warmth, while winter feels more 
				sterile and dark.
				<br>The game’s main concept was to associate each human life stage to a season, so as 
				the season change so does the character. Thus childhood (the first level) would be 
				played during spring, adolescence during summer and so on. As to maintain the 
				same visual language, the characters were design in a minimalistic and linear 
				fashion and their clothes colour scheme was chosen to match the specific season 
				they are associated with. Consequently, the adults are dressed in darker colours to 
				match autumn and the children are dressed in vibrant colours to match spring.</br></p>
