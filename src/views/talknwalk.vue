					<h2 class=" transition">A mental health app designed to connect patients and therapists more efficiently</h2>

					<p class="transition">Talknwalk was developed during a three-week sprint for an academic project. It was developed by a multidisciplinary team, made by designers, illustrators, developers, animators, photographers and journalists.<br>The project aim was to create an app that would breach the gap between people suffering from mental health problems and therapists, specifically in Portugal. A country where there is still a lot of stigma associated with mental health, patients often must rely on private practices to have access to a therapist which can be financially strenuous for someone who is on a budget. The team went through an ideation and brainstorming process, realising that TalknWalk offered benefits for both patients and therapists.<br>On one hand patients have access to a list of therapists with whom they can start chatting or video-call; the former can chat with a chat bot that will track their mood and offer statistics on their symptoms and, lastly, the patients’ interactions with the app and the bot will complete their profile allowing the app’s AI to send personalized recommendations, articles and mood boosters.<br>On the other hand, therapists will have access to a wider range of patients, the secure video-calls and chats allow them to work remotely thus being more independent and reducing commute and space renting costs, the therapists has access to information prior to the first interaction with the patient, if the later wishes so, making the diagnosis and therapy more efficient.<br>The team weighted in the fonts, colour scheme and brand identity as a group, and after that first brainstorming each member moved on with their tasks. Consequently, I researched the competition and designed the app’s user flow and main features for therapists and patients, followed by the low and high-fidelity wireframes for the team’s approval. Once the app’s UX /UI was finished, I dedicated the remaining time to the app’s website, which would act as a promotional tool for marketing.</p>
